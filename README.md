# Introduction
Blume (pronounced "bloom") is an experiment and project of mine written in Java. The goal was to create a simple API for printing 8-bit and 24-bit color characters to the terminal using ANSI escape codes with little to no hassle for the developer.

Blume is so far functional in Unix-like environments (e.g., Linux) and there are plans to expand its code to work in Windows-based environments as well.
